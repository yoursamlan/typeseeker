Try it out here - [typeseeker...](https://alexnjoroge.github.io/typeseeker/) 

## Getting Started
Set up a local server and serve the files to start playing the game.<br> 
A server is needed because the wordlist is being loaded from another file.<br>
A fast choice is the [Chrome Web Server extension](https://github.com/kzahel/web-server-chrome)<br>

## Difficulty Levels

The game has three difficulty levels that can be toggled between in the main.js file in the js folder:

  * Easy   - 5 seconds to type a word.
  * Medium - 3 seconds to type a word.
  * Hard   - 1 second to type a word.
