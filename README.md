# typeseeker... 
A speed-typing game that runs in a browser and has various difficulty levels that a user can choose between.

## Getting Started
Set up a local server and serve the files to start playing the game.<br> 
A server is needed because the wordlist is being loaded from another file.<br>
A fast choice is the [Chrome Web Server extension](https://github.com/kzahel/web-server-chrome)<br>
